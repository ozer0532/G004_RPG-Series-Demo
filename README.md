# RPG Series Project

Hey guys, I'm Ozer! This repository contains the complete project files for HMIF ITB GameDev Community RPG tutorial series, 
where we learn several concepts in Unity by making a basic 2D RPG game. Unfortunately, this tutorial is closed to the public, 
but you are welcome to check out what we made.
